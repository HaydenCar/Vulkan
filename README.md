# Vulkan

### What is this?:
This is my repository for learning how the Vulkan API and Graphics Programming works under the hood. This is being worked on as a learning hobby so do not expect pretty code. Supplementing with the book "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" by Steve Marschner.

### Requirements to run code:
- `Linux`
- `Vulkan Packages` - more info at [**Vulkan Docs**](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/02_Development_environment.html).
- `GLFW`
- `GLM`
- `GLSLC` 

### Commands to run code:
- `make clean`
- `make run`
