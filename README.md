### What is this?:
This is my repository for learning how the Vulkan API and Graphics work. This is being worked on as a learning hobby.

### Requirements to run code:
- `Linux`
- `Vulkan Packages` - more info at [**Vulkan Docs**](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/02_Development_environment.html).
- `GLFW`
- `GLM`
- `GLSLC` - only needed if you want to compile shaders yourself.

### Commands to run code:
